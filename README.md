Summary of the project Smart AR Shopping is an app which can be used to find the shortest possible path inside a mall or supermarket passing through all the places where user has to buy something. The path will be shown to the user by the means of arrows in his/har virtual camera.

For using the app user has to register once before using it for shopping purpose. The app uses PlayFab’s user authentication to authenticate the user and save the login info. Once the user get registered he will be directed to an options menu containing the list of all available stores in the mall as options. Now user has to select the things that he wishes to purchase from the mall. After selecting the options user has to click on the SUBMIT button in order to proceed further.

After this user’s mobile camera will be opened and as he will see his surrounding in the camera arrows will be shown to him in order to direct along the shortest path passing through all the stores where user has to buy something, this will be done using path renderer, vector list and AR core in thr unity. Now user has to follow the directions shown by arrows in his mobile camera and he will be notified by a message or alert tone as he reaches the stores where he is supposed to buy something.
